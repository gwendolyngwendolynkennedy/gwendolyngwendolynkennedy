### Hi there, how are you? ðŸ‘‹


My name is Gwendolyn. I'm a software engineer and â˜• enthusiast.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently looking to learn Rust and Elixir.

ðŸ’¬ Outside of development and web design, I love to play video games, talk about history, write some creative fiction, read speculative fiction, science fiction, and non-fiction books (mostly history), and listen to music (I'm a well-listened man!)
